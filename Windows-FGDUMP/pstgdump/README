pstgdump reveals interesting information stored in "protected storage" on Win2K, XP and 
2003. Despite it's marketing name, "protected" storage is really anything but protected.
The only thing that makes it slightly protected is that it's associated with a user's
profile, and you need a fairly poorly-documented API to read it. Much of the data
stored within, however, is stored in clear-text. Brilliant. Admittedly, some data (such
as Outlook Express passwords) are encrypted, but without salt, so decryption is as 
simply as calling CryptUnprotectData with the default NULL parameters.

An additional feature is listing "IdentitiesPass" information, which technically is not
a protected storage item, but nonetheless other similar tools show this info, so who am
I to break rank on this. :)

The parameters to it are very simple. In the most basic case, simply log on interactively
and run the executable with no parameters. Use the "-h" option to see other options. The
"-u" and "-p" options are primarily intended for embedding within scripts and other 
programs (like fgdump). 

Some of this code comes from an example shown on The Code Project at:

While I do not want to disparage the hard work of this person, a lot of things did not
work very well for me, and I found the code quite hard to read. Nonetheless, some of it
ended up in pstgdump with some enhancements. Other parts were obtained through what I 
will only refer to as "other means". :) Some of it, quite frankly, is semi-educated
guessing, so please inform me of any problems you might have while running this.

Please let me know if this is useful to you, and I welcome (constructive) comments and
suggestions at fizzgig@foofus.net.
