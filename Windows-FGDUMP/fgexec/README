** fgexec- A support service for fgdump **

Greets to all my fellow Foofites: j0m0-Kun (who is the inspiration for this program), 
phenfen, omi, fade, pmonkey, grunch and of course our namesake foofus.

The original version of fgdump used psservice to perform some of its work. 
After reading the license agreement for that program, I determined that
doing so was in violation of the EULA, so I abandoned that and created fgexec. FGExec
just performs the task of executing a file on a remote host, it's certainly nothing fancy.
